# Branch Metrics Android SDK

This is the repository of our open source Android SDK. There's a full demo app embedded in this repository, but you should also check out our live demo: [Branch Monster Factory](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.branch.branchster). We've [open sourced the Branchster's app](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Branchster-Android) as well if you'd like to dig in.

## Important migration to v1.5.0

We have deprecated the bnc_app_key and replaced that with the new branch_key. Please see [add Branch key](#add-your-branch-key-to-your-project) for details.

## Important migration to v1.4.5

Branch uses Facebook's App Links metatags automatically to provide the best linking from the Facebook platform. Unfortunately, Facebook changed the way they handle App Links routing in the latest update on April 8ish.

Two important things to do in order to properly handle deep links from Facebook

1. Make sure to update the Manifest so that the Activity with the intent filter for your URI scheme has *launchMode:singleTask*. See example [here](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Android-SDK#register-an-activity-for-direct-deep-linking-optional-but-recommended)

2. Make sure to add this snippet of code to the Activity registered as singleTask.
```java
@Override
public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    // Because the activity is a singleTask activity, the new intent won't be
    // launched but enters here, making handling it optional. For branch to work
    // the intent must be updated by calling the following:
    this.setIntent(intent);
}
```

3. Update the SDK to v1.4.5 or higher

## FAQ

1.) __What if Branch goes down or there is a poor connection?__

At Branch, we live and breath uptime &amp; performance. We've developed mechanisms internal to the SDK to deal with network issues. We always call the callbacks with the error parameter describing the issue. If the phone is in airplane mode and the connection is not available, the callbacks are called immediately. If there is a server latency, we timeout after 3 seconds and will retry 4 more times with a 3 second pause in between each. These timeouts are adjustable on the singleton instance by calling: ```setNetworkTimeout``` (ms), ```setRetryCount``` and ```setRetryInterval``` (ms).

2.) __How can I debug or test the SDK?__

Just add ```<meta-data android:name="io.branch.sdk.TestMode" android:value="true" />``` in the Manifest. We'll log all requests. More importantly, we won't reference the hardware ID of the phone so you can register installs after uninstalling and reinstalling the app.

** If you aren't using automatic session management, then you must use ```branch.getTestInstance(getApplicationContext())```**

*Note: Make sure to remove this line before releasing!*

3.) __Is there any way to start debugging dynamically?__

Yes. Even if you don't use the manifest metadata you can still start debugging dynamically. When you are testing your app, just put four fingers on your phone screen (or just single touch on simulator) and hold for three seconds, and you should be able to see an indication of start debug session in the log. From then on, all requests will be logged. If you have signed into our dashboard at that time and are in the "Debug" page, this will even start a remote debug session. To enable this feature, make sure you pass "this" as the third parameter when you call ```initSession``` in the Activity's ```onStart()```.

4.) __Why do I not see any installs after I reinstall?__

We do a lot of smart things to give you an accurate read on the number of installs you actually have. The most common one is associating the user with the actual hardware ID of the phone. If a user uninstalls the app, then reinstalls, we'll know it's the same person from before and just register the user as 'open' instead of an 'install.' To register an install on the same phone again, see FAQ #2 about debugging.

5.) __Chrome seems to take me to Google Play all the time. Why?__

Chrome is very picky about opening up the app directly. Chrome utilizes the intent system to try to open up the app, and fails back to the Play Store far too easily. Here are 3 things to verify:

  1. Make sure the package name for the test build matches the package registered in the Branch settings and matches the package in Google play.

  2. Make sure the URI scheme of the test build matches the Branch settings.

  3. Verify that you've added the proper host 'open' in the Manifest - see [here](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Android-SDK#register-an-activity-for-direct-deep-linking-optional-but-recommended)


## Installation

Current compiled SDK footprint is *40kb*

### Install library project

Just add `compile 'io.branch.sdk.android:library:1.+'` to the dependencies section of your `build.gradle` file.

Or download the JAR file from here:
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/branchhost/Branch-Android-SDK.zip

The testbed project:
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/branchhost/Branch-Android-TestBed.zip

Or just clone this project!

### Register Your App

You can sign up for your own app id at [https://dashboard.branch.io](https://dashboard.branch.io)

## Configuration (for tracking)

Ideally, you want to use our links any time you have an external link pointing to your app (share, invite, referral, etc) because:

1. Our dashboard can tell you where your installs are coming from
1. Our links are the highest possible converting channel to new downloads and users
1. You can pass that shared data across install to give new users a custom welcome or show them the content they expect to see

Our linking infrastructure will support anything you want to build. If it doesn't, we'll fix it so that it does: just reach out to alex@branch.io with requests.

### Register an activity for direct deep linking (optional but recommended)

In your project's manifest file, you can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block. Also, make sure to change **yourapp** to a unique string that represents your app name.

Secondly, make sure that this activity is launched as a singleTask. This is important to handle proper deep linking from other apps like Facebook.

Typically, you would register some sort of splash activitiy that handles routing for your app.

```xml
<activity
    android:name="com.yourapp.SplashActivity"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    <!-- Make sure the activity is launched as "singleTask" -->
    android:launchMode="singleTask"
     >
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>

    <!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->
    <intent-filter>
        <data android:scheme="yourapp" android:host="open" />
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```
### Leverage Android AppLink for deep linking

If you are building applications targeting for Android M or above, Branch make it really easy to configure your app for deep linking using AppLinks.
In your project's manifest file, you can register activities to for AppLinking by adding an intent filter as follows. You only need to know `your_live_app_id`
and `your_test_app_id` which you can obtain from the Branch dash board once you enable AppLinking support for your application.

```xml
  <activity android:name="com.yourapp.your_activity">
            <!-- AppLink your activity to Branch links-->
            <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
                <data android:scheme="https" android:host="bnc.lt" android:pathPrefix="/your_live_app_id" /> <!-- your_live_app_id can be obtained from Branch dash board -->
                <data android:scheme="https" android:host="bnc.lt" android:pathPrefix="/your_test_app_id" /> <!-- your_test_app_id can be obtained from Branch dash board -->
                <!-- If you set up a white label for your links in your Branch link settngs then  only need to add the white label domain -->
                <data android:scheme="https" android:host="your.app.com"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        ```
That's all you need. Deep linked parameters associated with the link is passed through Branch initialization process.

Note: While using AppLinks please make sure you have registered the Activity for deeplinking using Branch URI scheme as discussed in the previous session inorder to get deeplink work on previous versions of Android
(which does not support AppLinks).

### Configure your AndroidManifest.xml
**1. Provide internet permission. Branch SDK need internet access to talk to Branch APIs.**

**2. Specify a versionName attribute in the manifest for Branch to identify the application version.**

**3. Add your Branch key to your project.**

After you register your app, your Branch key can be retrieved on the [Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings) page of the dashboard. Add it (them, if you want to do it for both your live and test apps) to your project's manifest file as a meta data.

 Edit your manifest file to have the above items
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="io.branch.sample"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0" >

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

    <application>
        <!-- Other existing entries -->

        <!-- Add this meta-data below, and change "key_live_xxxxxxx" to your actual live Branch key -->
        <meta-data android:name="io.branch.sdk.BranchKey" android:value="key_live_xxxxxxx" />

        <!-- For your test app, if you have one; Again, use your actual test Branch key -->
        <meta-data android:name="io.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test" android:value="key_test_yyyyyyy" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### Proguard settings
If your Application is enabled with proguard, add the following instruction to your proguard.cfg file:
```bash
-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.** { *; }
```

## Initialization

Branch must be notified when the app opens and when it closes, so that we know when to query the API for a new deep link. We recently discovered an Android mechanism that was exposed in version 14, that allows us to track behind-the-scenes when the app is opened and closed. It makes the integration **a lot** easier, so we've split it out from the legacy integration.

If you support below 14, you'll want to skip this section and head to [this one right below](initialization-to-support-android-pre-14-harder).

### Initialization to support Android 14+ (4.0+) (easy)

To receive the deep link parameters from the Branch SDK, call initSession and pass in the BranchReferralInitListener. This will return the dictionary of referringParams associated with the link that was just clicked. You can call this anywhere at any time to get the params.

#### Initialize Branch lifecycle

Starting from Branch SDK version 1.5.7, there is no need for initialising and closing session with the new _automatic session management_. Automatic session management can work only with API level 14 and above, so make sure that your `minSdkVersion` is 14 or above.

```xml
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="14"/>
```

Once you do any of the below, there is no need to close or init sessions in your Activities. Branch SDK will do all that for you. You can get your Branch instance at any time as follows.

If you are not creating or using an Application class throughout your project, all you need to do is declare `BranchApp` as your application class in your manifest.

```xml
 <application
    android:name="io.branch.referral.BranchApp">
```

#### Register deep link router

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){
    @Override
    public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {
        if (error == null) {
            // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app
            // params will be empty if no data found
            // ... insert custom logic here ...
        } else {
            Log.i("MyApp", error.getMessage());
        }
    }
}, this.getIntent().getData(), this);
```

**NOTE** if you're calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in `this`. Also, `this.getIntent().getData()` refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.

Next, you'll need to hook into the `onNewIntent` method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook's AppLinks. Verify that the activity you're implementing has *launchMode* set to *singleTask* inside the Manifest declaration. Once that'd done, go to said activity and do something like the following:

```java
@Override
public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    this.setIntent(intent);
}
```

Side note: This is a requirement because of the new Facebook AppLinks change. Facebook doesn't open up the browser anymore and just calls the URI to open the app directly. This prevented Branch clicks from being registered. To support it, we pass that link click id through the URI scheme to Branch, and send that back to the app, creating a 'click' without actually seeing a click. Android does a very poor job of clearing out intents that were previously called, so this helps ensure that once a URI scheme is called and consumed, it won't trigger deep linking anymore.

#### Branch-provided data parameters in initSession callback

Previously, Branch did not return any information to the app if `initSession` was called but the user hadn't clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.

* `~` denotes analytics
* `+` denotes information added by Branch
* (for the curious, `$` denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)

| **Parameter** | **Meaning**
| ~channel | The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time
| ~feature | The feature, such as `invite` or `share`, specified at link creation time
| ~tags | Any tags, specified at link creation time
| ~campaign | The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time
| ~stage | The stage, specified at link creation time
| ~creation_source | Where the link was created ('API', 'Dashboard', 'SDK', 'iOS SDK', 'Android SDK', or 'Web SDK')
| +referrer | The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked
| +phone_number | The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app
| +is_first_session | Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)
| +clicked_branch_link | Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session

### Initialization to support Android pre-14 (harder)

Note: There is no need to use this section if you use _automatic session management_ as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14. Please skip to the [next section](#retrieve-session-install-or-open-parameters) and proceed. This section is only needed if you want to support pre-14.

If you choose this method, you must call initSession and closeSession in onStart and onStop of _every Activity_ in your app. If you don't close the Branch session, you'll see strange behaviors like deep link parameters not showing up after clicking a link the second time. Branch must know when the app opens or closes to properly handle the deep link parameters retrieval.

#### Init Session

**NOTE** This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the Android UI lifecycle. A single Branch object instance is used per Activity or Fragment, so declare an object at the class-level, and you can call this in every Activity or Fragment where you need to interact with Branch; if it has already be initialised elsewhere in your app, the same instance will be returned.

Inside your onStart, do the following, where the variable branch is created in your base activity class (of type Branch). This will initialize a Branch session and return the deep link parameters associated with the link that was just clicked, or an empty dictionary if not.

```java
@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){
        @Override
        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {
            if (error == null) {
                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app
                // params will be empty if no data found
                // ... insert custom logic here ...
            } else {
                Log.i("MyApp", error.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);
}
```

**NOTE** if you're calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in `this`. Also, `this.getIntent().getData()` refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.

Next, you'll need to hook into the `onNewIntent` method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook's AppLinks. Verify that the activity you're implementing has *launchMode* set to *singleTask* inside the Manifest declaration. Once that'd done, go to said activity and do something like the following:

```java
@Override
public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    this.setIntent(intent);
}
```

#### Close session

Note: There is no need to use this method if you use _automatic session management_ as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14

Every activity that will use Branch in some way should include Branch SDK methods in both `onStart()` and `onStop()`. Don't forget `closeSession()` in every activity with Branch! If you don't close the Branch session, you'll see strange behaviors like deep link parameters not showing up after clicking a link the second time.

```java
@Override
protected void onStop() {
    super.onStop();
    branch.closeSession();
}
```

#### Branch-provided data parameters in initSession callback

Previously, Branch did not return any information to the app if `initSession` was called but the user hadn't clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.

* `~` denotes analytics
* `+` denotes information added by Branch
* (for the curious, `$` denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)

| **Parameter** | **Meaning**
| ~channel | The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time
| ~feature | The feature, such as `invite` or `share`, specified at link creation time
| ~tags | Any tags, specified at link creation time
| ~campaign | The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time
| ~stage | The stage, specified at link creation time
| ~creation_source | Where the link was created ('API', 'Dashboard', 'SDK', 'iOS SDK', 'Android SDK', or 'Web SDK')
| +referrer | The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked
| +phone_number | The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app
| +is_first_session | Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)
| +clicked_branch_link | Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session

#### Retrieve session (install or open) parameters

These session parameters will be available at any point later on with this command. If no params, the dictionary will be empty. This refreshes with every new session (app installs AND app opens)
```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
JSONObject sessionParams = branch.getLatestReferringParams();
```

#### Retrieve install (install only) parameters

If you ever want to access the original session params (the parameters passed in for the first install event only), you can use this line. This is useful if you only want to reward users who newly installed the app from a referral link or something.
```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
JSONObject installParams = branch.getFirstReferringParams();
```

### Persistent identities

Often, you might have your own user IDs, or want referral and event data to persist across platforms or uninstall/reinstall. It's helpful if you know your users access your service from different devices. This where we introduce the concept of an 'identity'.

To identify a user, just call:
```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.setIdentity(your user id); // your user id should not exceed 127 characters
```

#### Logout

If you provide a logout function in your app, be sure to clear the user when the logout completes. This will ensure that all the stored parameters get cleared and all events are properly attributed to the right identity.

**Warning** this call will clear the referral credits and attribution on the device.

```java
Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).logout();
```

### Register custom events

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.userCompletedAction("your_custom_event"); // your custom event name should not exceed 63 characters
```

OR if you want to store some state with the event

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.userCompletedAction("your_custom_event", (JSONObject)appState); // same 63 characters max limit
```

Some example events you might want to track:
```java
"complete_purchase"
"wrote_message"
"finished_level_ten"
```

## Generate Tracked, Deep Linking URLs (pass data across install and open)

### Shortened links

There are a bunch of options for creating these links. You can tag them for analytics in the dashboard, or you can even pass data to the new installs or opens that come from the link click. How awesome is that? You need to pass a callback for when you link is prepared (which should return very quickly, ~ 50 ms to process).

For more details on how to create links, see the [Branch link creation guide](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Integration-Guides/blob/master/url-creation-guide.md)

```java
// associate data with a link
// you can access this data from any instance that installs or opens the app from this link (amazing...)

JSONObject dataToInclude = new JSONObject();
try {
    dataToInclude.put("user", "Joe");
    dataToInclude.put("profile_pic", "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/myapp/joes_pic.jpg");
    dataToInclude.put("description", "Joe likes long walks on the beach...")

    // customize the display of the Branch link
    dataToInclude.put("$og_title", "Joe's My App Referral");
    dataToInclude.put("$og_image_url", "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/myapp/joes_pic.jpg");
    dataToInclude.put("$og_description", "Join Joe in My App - it's awesome");

    // customize the desktop redirect location
    dataToInclude.put("$desktop_url", "http://myapp.com/desktop_splash");
} catch (JSONException ex) { }

// associate a url with a set of tags, channel, feature, and stage for better analytics.
// tags: null or example set of tags could be "version1", "trial6", etc; each tag should not exceed 64 characters
// channel: null or examples: "facebook", "twitter", "text_message", etc; should not exceed 128 characters
// feature: null or examples: Branch.FEATURE_TAG_SHARE, Branch.FEATURE_TAG_REFERRAL, "unlock", etc; should not exceed 128 characters
// stage: null or examples: "past_customer", "logged_in", "level_6"; should not exceed 128 characters

ArrayList<String> tags = new ArrayList<String>();
tags.put("version1");
tags.put("trial6");

// Link 'type' can be used for scenarios where you want the link to only deep link the first time.
// Use _null_, _LINK_TYPE_UNLIMITED_USE_ or _LINK_TYPE_ONE_TIME_USE_

// Link 'alias' can be used to label the endpoint on the link. For example: http://bnc.lt/AUSTIN28. Should not exceed 128 characters
// Be careful about aliases: these are immutable objects permanently associated with the data and associated paramters you pass into the link. When you create one in the SDK, it's tied to that user identity as well (automatically specified by the Branch internals). If you want to retrieve the same link again, you'll need to call getShortUrl with all of the same parameters from before.

Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.getShortUrl(tags, "text_message", Branch.FEATURE_TAG_SHARE, "level_3", dataToInclude, new BranchLinkCreateListener() {
    @Override
    public void onLinkCreate(String url, Branch.BranchError error) {
        if (error == null) {
            // show the link to the user or share it immediately
        } else {
            Log.i("MyApp", error.getMessage());
        }
    }
});

// The callback will return null if the link generation fails (or if the alias specified is aleady taken.)
```

There are other methods which exclude tags and data if you don't want to pass those. Explore the autocomplete functionality.

**Note**
You can customize the Facebook OG tags of each URL if you want to dynamically share content by using the following _optional keys in the data dictionary_. Please use this [Facebook tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object) to debug your OG tags!

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$og_title" | The title you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_description" | The description you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_image_url" | The URL for the image you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_video" | The URL for the video
| "$og_url" | The URL you'd like to appear
| "$og_redirect" | If you want to bypass our OG tags and use your own, use this key with the URL that contains your site's metadata.

Also, you do custom redirection by inserting the following _optional keys in the dictionary_:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$desktop_url" | Where to send the user on a desktop or laptop. By default it is the Branch-hosted text-me service
| "$android_url" | The replacement URL for the Play Store to send the user if they don't have the app. _Only necessary if you want a mobile web splash_
| "$ios_url" | The replacement URL for the App Store to send the user if they don't have the app. _Only necessary if you want a mobile web splash_
| "$ipad_url" | Same as above but for iPad Store
| "$fire_url" | Same as above but for Amazon Fire Store
| "$blackberry_url" | Same as above but for Blackberry Store
| "$windows_phone_url" | Same as above but for Windows Store

You have the ability to control the direct deep linking of each link by inserting the following _optional keys in the dictionary_:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$deeplink_path" | The value of the deep link path that you'd like us to append to your URI. For example, you could specify "$deeplink_path": "radio/station/456" and we'll open the app with the URI "yourapp://radio/station/456?link_click_id=branch-identifier". This is primarily for supporting legacy deep linking infrastructure.
| "$always_deeplink" | true or false. (default is not to deep link first) This key can be specified to have our linking service force try to open the app, even if we're not sure the user has the app installed. If the app is not installed, we fall back to the respective app store or $platform_url key. By default, we only open the app if we've seen a user initiate a session in your app from a Branch link (has been cookied and deep linked by Branch)

### Deep link Activities

Branch provides a very easy and powerful automatic deep linking to Activities. You can configure Activities to be launched on clicking a link. Here is how you configure an Activity for auto deep linking.

1) Configure auto deep link keys for Activity in manifest file

```xml
<activity android:name=".AutoDeepLinkTestActivity">
     <!-- Keys for auto deep linking this activity -->
     <meta-data android:name="io.branch.sdk.auto_link_keys" android:value="auto_deeplink_key_1,auto_deeplink_key_2" />
     <!-- Optional request ID for launching this activity on auto deep link key matches -->
     <meta-data android:name="io.branch.sdk.auto_link_request_code" android:value="@integer/AutoDeeplinkRequestCode" />
</activity>
```

2) Create a link with deep link keys.

While you create the link you can specify the deep link keys in the JSONObject parameters you pass for creating a link.

```java
JSONObject dataToInclude = new JSONObject();
try {
    dataToInclude.put("name", "test name");
    dataToInclude.put("auto_deeplink_key_1", "This is an auto deep linked key's value");
} catch (JSONException ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
String autoDeepLikedUrl = branch.getShortUrlSync(dataToInclude);
 ```

That's it. Now clicking on a link Branch will check for Activities which are matching for auto deep linking and Launch that Activity. Optionally you can configure a request code to launch the Activity in auto deep link mode in your manifest as
as shown above. Do this if you want to handle something on auto deep linked Activity finish on your main activity as the example below.

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    //Checking if the previous activity is launched on Branch Auto deep link.
    if(requestCode == getResources().getInteger(R.integer.AutoDeeplinkRequestCode)){
        //Decide here where  to navigate  when an auto deep linked activity finishes.For e.g. go to HomeActivity or a  SignUp Activity.
        Intent i = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), SignUpActivity.class);
        startActivity(i);
    }
}
```

Your deep linked parameters are added to the intent extra with the same key you have used in the JSONObject for creating the link.

```java
String name = getIntent().getExtras().getString("name");
```

You can also get the deep linked parameters as the original JSONObject that you used for link creation

```java
JSONObject linkedParams = Branch.getInstance().getLatestReferringParams();
```

## Referral system rewarding functionality

In a standard referral system, you have 2 parties: the original user and the invitee. Our system is flexible enough to handle rewards for all users. Here are a couple example scenarios:

1) Reward the original user for taking action (eg. inviting, purchasing, etc)

2) Reward the invitee for installing the app from the original user's referral link

3) Reward the original user when the invitee takes action (eg. give the original user credit when their the invitee buys something)

These reward definitions are created on the dashboard, under the 'Reward Rules' section in the 'Referrals' tab on the dashboard.

Warning: For a referral program, you should not use unique awards for custom events and redeem pre-identify call. This can allow users to cheat the system.

### Get reward balance

Reward balances change randomly on the backend when certain actions are taken (defined by your rules), so you'll need to make an asynchronous call to retrieve the balance. Here is the syntax:

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.loadRewards(new BranchReferralStateChangedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onStateChanged(boolean changed, Branch.BranchError error) {
        // changed boolean will indicate if the balance changed from what is currently in memory

        // will return the balance of the current user's credits
        int credits = branch.getCredits();
    }
});
```

### Redeem all or some of the reward balance (store state)

We will store how many of the rewards have been deployed so that you don't have to track it on your end. In order to save that you gave the credits to the user, you can call redeem. Redemptions will reduce the balance of outstanding credits permanently.

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.redeemRewards(5);
```

### Get credit history

This call will retrieve the entire history of credits and redemptions from the individual user. To use this call, implement like so:

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.getCreditHistory(new BranchListResponseListener() {
    public void onReceivingResponse(JSONArray list, Branch.BranchError error) {
        if (error == null) {
            // show the list in your app
        } else {
            Log.i("MyApp", error.getMessage());
        }
    }
});
```

The response will return an array that has been parsed from the following JSON:
```json
[
    {
        "transaction": {
                           "date": "2014-10-14T01:54:40.425Z",

                           "amount": -3
                       },
        "event" : {
            "name": "event name",

        },
        "referrer": null,
        "referree": "12345678"
    }
]
```
**referrer**
: The id of the referring user for this credit transaction. Returns null if no referrer is involved. Note this id is the user id in developer's own system that's previously passed to Branch's identify user API call.

**referree**
: The id of the user who was referred for this credit transaction. Returns null if no referree is involved. Note this id is the user id in developer's own system that's previously passed to Branch's identify user API call.

**type**
: This is the type of credit transaction

1. _0_ - A reward that was added automatically by the user completing an action or referral
1. _1_ - A reward that was added manually
2. _2_ - A redemption of credits that occurred through our API or SDKs
3. _3_ - This is a very unique case where we will subtract credits automatically when we detect fraud
