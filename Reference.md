#### Register deep link router

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){
    @Override
    public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {
        if (error == null) {
            // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app
            // params will be empty if no data found
            // ... insert custom logic here ...
        } else {
            Log.i("MyApp", error.getMessage());
        }
    }
}, this.getIntent().getData(), this);
```

**NOTE** if you're calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in `this`. Also, `this.getIntent().getData()` refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.

Next, you'll need to hook into the `onNewIntent` method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook's AppLinks. Verify that the activity you're implementing has *launchMode* set to *singleTask* inside the Manifest declaration. Once that'd done, go to said activity and do something like the following:

```java
@Override
public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    this.setIntent(intent);
}
```

Side note: This is a requirement because of the new Facebook AppLinks change. Facebook doesn't open up the browser anymore and just calls the URI to open the app directly. This prevented Branch clicks from being registered. To support it, we pass that link click id through the URI scheme to Branch, and send that back to the app, creating a 'click' without actually seeing a click. Android does a very poor job of clearing out intents that were previously called, so this helps ensure that once a URI scheme is called and consumed, it won't trigger deep linking anymore.

#### Branch-provided data parameters in initSession callback

Previously, Branch did not return any information to the app if `initSession` was called but the user hadn't clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.

* `~` denotes analytics
* `+` denotes information added by Branch
* (for the curious, `$` denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)

| **Parameter** | **Meaning**
| ~channel | The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time
| ~feature | The feature, such as `invite` or `share`, specified at link creation time
| ~tags | Any tags, specified at link creation time
| ~campaign | The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time
| ~stage | The stage, specified at link creation time
| ~creation_source | Where the link was created ('API', 'Dashboard', 'SDK', 'iOS SDK', 'Android SDK', or 'Web SDK')
| +referrer | The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked
| +phone_number | The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app
| +is_first_session | Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)
| +clicked_branch_link | Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session

### Initialization to support Android pre-14 (harder)

Note: There is no need to use this section if you use _automatic session management_ as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14. Please skip to the [next section](#retrieve-session-install-or-open-parameters) and proceed. This section is only needed if you want to support pre-14.

If you choose this method, you must call initSession and closeSession in onStart and onStop of _every Activity_ in your app. If you don't close the Branch session, you'll see strange behaviors like deep link parameters not showing up after clicking a link the second time. Branch must know when the app opens or closes to properly handle the deep link parameters retrieval.

#### Init Session

**NOTE** This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the Android UI lifecycle. A single Branch object instance is used per Activity or Fragment, so declare an object at the class-level, and you can call this in every Activity or Fragment where you need to interact with Branch; if it has already be initialised elsewhere in your app, the same instance will be returned.

Inside your onStart, do the following, where the variable branch is created in your base activity class (of type Branch). This will initialize a Branch session and return the deep link parameters associated with the link that was just clicked, or an empty dictionary if not.

```java
@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){
        @Override
        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {
            if (error == null) {
                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app
                // params will be empty if no data found
                // ... insert custom logic here ...
            } else {
                Log.i("MyApp", error.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);
}
```

**NOTE** if you're calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in `this`. Also, `this.getIntent().getData()` refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.

Next, you'll need to hook into the `onNewIntent` method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook's AppLinks. Verify that the activity you're implementing has *launchMode* set to *singleTask* inside the Manifest declaration. Once that'd done, go to said activity and do something like the following:

```java
@Override
public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    this.setIntent(intent);
}
```

#### Close session

Note: There is no need to use this method if you use _automatic session management_ as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14

Every activity that will use Branch in some way should include Branch SDK methods in both `onStart()` and `onStop()`. Don't forget `closeSession()` in every activity with Branch! If you don't close the Branch session, you'll see strange behaviors like deep link parameters not showing up after clicking a link the second time.

```java
@Override
protected void onStop() {
    super.onStop();
    branch.closeSession();
}
```

#### Branch-provided data parameters in initSession callback

Previously, Branch did not return any information to the app if `initSession` was called but the user hadn't clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.

* `~` denotes analytics
* `+` denotes information added by Branch
* (for the curious, `$` denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)

| **Parameter** | **Meaning**
| ~channel | The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time
| ~feature | The feature, such as `invite` or `share`, specified at link creation time
| ~tags | Any tags, specified at link creation time
| ~campaign | The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time
| ~stage | The stage, specified at link creation time
| ~creation_source | Where the link was created ('API', 'Dashboard', 'SDK', 'iOS SDK', 'Android SDK', or 'Web SDK')
| +referrer | The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked
| +phone_number | The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app
| +is_first_session | Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)
| +clicked_branch_link | Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session

#### Retrieve session (install or open) parameters

These session parameters will be available at any point later on with this command. If no params, the dictionary will be empty. This refreshes with every new session (app installs AND app opens)
```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
JSONObject sessionParams = branch.getLatestReferringParams();
```

#### Retrieve install (install only) parameters

If you ever want to access the original session params (the parameters passed in for the first install event only), you can use this line. This is useful if you only want to reward users who newly installed the app from a referral link or something.
```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
JSONObject installParams = branch.getFirstReferringParams();
```

### Persistent identities

Often, you might have your own user IDs, or want referral and event data to persist across platforms or uninstall/reinstall. It's helpful if you know your users access your service from different devices. This where we introduce the concept of an 'identity'.

To identify a user, just call:
```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.setIdentity(your user id); // your user id should not exceed 127 characters
```

#### Logout

If you provide a logout function in your app, be sure to clear the user when the logout completes. This will ensure that all the stored parameters get cleared and all events are properly attributed to the right identity.

**Warning** this call will clear the referral credits and attribution on the device.

```java
Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).logout();
```

### Register custom events

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.userCompletedAction("your_custom_event"); // your custom event name should not exceed 63 characters
```

OR if you want to store some state with the event

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.userCompletedAction("your_custom_event", (JSONObject)appState); // same 63 characters max limit
```

Some example events you might want to track:
```java
"complete_purchase"
"wrote_message"
"finished_level_ten"
```

## Generate Tracked, Deep Linking URLs (pass data across install and open)

### Shortened links

There are a bunch of options for creating these links. You can tag them for analytics in the dashboard, or you can even pass data to the new installs or opens that come from the link click. How awesome is that? You need to pass a callback for when you link is prepared (which should return very quickly, ~ 50 ms to process).

For more details on how to create links, see the [Branch link creation guide](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Integration-Guides/blob/master/url-creation-guide.md)

```java
// associate data with a link
// you can access this data from any instance that installs or opens the app from this link (amazing...)

JSONObject dataToInclude = new JSONObject();
try {
    dataToInclude.put("user", "Joe");
    dataToInclude.put("profile_pic", "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/myapp/joes_pic.jpg");
    dataToInclude.put("description", "Joe likes long walks on the beach...")

    // customize the display of the Branch link
    dataToInclude.put("$og_title", "Joe's My App Referral");
    dataToInclude.put("$og_image_url", "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/myapp/joes_pic.jpg");
    dataToInclude.put("$og_description", "Join Joe in My App - it's awesome");

    // customize the desktop redirect location
    dataToInclude.put("$desktop_url", "http://myapp.com/desktop_splash");
} catch (JSONException ex) { }

// associate a url with a set of tags, channel, feature, and stage for better analytics.
// tags: null or example set of tags could be "version1", "trial6", etc; each tag should not exceed 64 characters
// channel: null or examples: "facebook", "twitter", "text_message", etc; should not exceed 128 characters
// feature: null or examples: Branch.FEATURE_TAG_SHARE, Branch.FEATURE_TAG_REFERRAL, "unlock", etc; should not exceed 128 characters
// stage: null or examples: "past_customer", "logged_in", "level_6"; should not exceed 128 characters

ArrayList<String> tags = new ArrayList<String>();
tags.put("version1");
tags.put("trial6");

// Link 'type' can be used for scenarios where you want the link to only deep link the first time.
// Use _null_, _LINK_TYPE_UNLIMITED_USE_ or _LINK_TYPE_ONE_TIME_USE_

// Link 'alias' can be used to label the endpoint on the link. For example: http://bnc.lt/AUSTIN28. Should not exceed 128 characters
// Be careful about aliases: these are immutable objects permanently associated with the data and associated paramters you pass into the link. When you create one in the SDK, it's tied to that user identity as well (automatically specified by the Branch internals). If you want to retrieve the same link again, you'll need to call getShortUrl with all of the same parameters from before.

Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.getShortUrl(tags, "text_message", Branch.FEATURE_TAG_SHARE, "level_3", dataToInclude, new BranchLinkCreateListener() {
    @Override
    public void onLinkCreate(String url, Branch.BranchError error) {
        if (error == null) {
            // show the link to the user or share it immediately
        } else {
            Log.i("MyApp", error.getMessage());
        }
    }
});

// The callback will return null if the link generation fails (or if the alias specified is aleady taken.)
```

There are other methods which exclude tags and data if you don't want to pass those. Explore the autocomplete functionality.

**Note**
You can customize the Facebook OG tags of each URL if you want to dynamically share content by using the following _optional keys in the data dictionary_. Please use this [Facebook tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object) to debug your OG tags!

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$og_title" | The title you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_description" | The description you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_image_url" | The URL for the image you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_video" | The URL for the video
| "$og_url" | The URL you'd like to appear
| "$og_redirect" | If you want to bypass our OG tags and use your own, use this key with the URL that contains your site's metadata.

Also, you do custom redirection by inserting the following _optional keys in the dictionary_:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$desktop_url" | Where to send the user on a desktop or laptop. By default it is the Branch-hosted text-me service
| "$android_url" | The replacement URL for the Play Store to send the user if they don't have the app. _Only necessary if you want a mobile web splash_
| "$ios_url" | The replacement URL for the App Store to send the user if they don't have the app. _Only necessary if you want a mobile web splash_
| "$ipad_url" | Same as above but for iPad Store
| "$fire_url" | Same as above but for Amazon Fire Store
| "$blackberry_url" | Same as above but for Blackberry Store
| "$windows_phone_url" | Same as above but for Windows Store

You have the ability to control the direct deep linking of each link by inserting the following _optional keys in the dictionary_:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$deeplink_path" | The value of the deep link path that you'd like us to append to your URI. For example, you could specify "$deeplink_path": "radio/station/456" and we'll open the app with the URI "yourapp://radio/station/456?link_click_id=branch-identifier". This is primarily for supporting legacy deep linking infrastructure.
| "$always_deeplink" | true or false. (default is not to deep link first) This key can be specified to have our linking service force try to open the app, even if we're not sure the user has the app installed. If the app is not installed, we fall back to the respective app store or $platform_url key. By default, we only open the app if we've seen a user initiate a session in your app from a Branch link (has been cookied and deep linked by Branch)

### Deep link Activities

Branch provides a very easy and powerful automatic deep linking to Activities. You can configure Activities to be launched on clicking a link. Here is how you configure an Activity for auto deep linking.

1) Configure auto deep link keys for Activity in manifest file

```xml
<activity android:name=".AutoDeepLinkTestActivity">
     <!-- Keys for auto deep linking this activity -->
     <meta-data android:name="io.branch.sdk.auto_link_keys" android:value="auto_deeplink_key_1,auto_deeplink_key_2" />
     <!-- Optional request ID for launching this activity on auto deep link key matches -->
     <meta-data android:name="io.branch.sdk.auto_link_request_code" android:value="@integer/AutoDeeplinkRequestCode" />
</activity>
```

2) Create a link with deep link keys.

While you create the link you can specify the deep link keys in the JSONObject parameters you pass for creating a link.

```java
JSONObject dataToInclude = new JSONObject();
try {
    dataToInclude.put("name", "test name");
    dataToInclude.put("auto_deeplink_key_1", "This is an auto deep linked key's value");
} catch (JSONException ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
String autoDeepLikedUrl = branch.getShortUrlSync(dataToInclude);
 ```

That's it. Now clicking on a link Branch will check for Activities which are matching for auto deep linking and Launch that Activity. Optionally you can configure a request code to launch the Activity in auto deep link mode in your manifest as
as shown above. Do this if you want to handle something on auto deep linked Activity finish on your main activity as the example below.

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    //Checking if the previous activity is launched on Branch Auto deep link.
    if(requestCode == getResources().getInteger(R.integer.AutoDeeplinkRequestCode)){
        //Decide here where  to navigate  when an auto deep linked activity finishes.For e.g. go to HomeActivity or a  SignUp Activity.
        Intent i = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), SignUpActivity.class);
        startActivity(i);
    }
}
```

Your deep linked parameters are added to the intent extra with the same key you have used in the JSONObject for creating the link.

```java
String name = getIntent().getExtras().getString("name");
```

You can also get the deep linked parameters as the original JSONObject that you used for link creation

```java
JSONObject linkedParams = Branch.getInstance().getLatestReferringParams();
```

## Referral system rewarding functionality

In a standard referral system, you have 2 parties: the original user and the invitee. Our system is flexible enough to handle rewards for all users. Here are a couple example scenarios:

1) Reward the original user for taking action (eg. inviting, purchasing, etc)

2) Reward the invitee for installing the app from the original user's referral link

3) Reward the original user when the invitee takes action (eg. give the original user credit when their the invitee buys something)

These reward definitions are created on the dashboard, under the 'Reward Rules' section in the 'Referrals' tab on the dashboard.

Warning: For a referral program, you should not use unique awards for custom events and redeem pre-identify call. This can allow users to cheat the system.

### Get reward balance

Reward balances change randomly on the backend when certain actions are taken (defined by your rules), so you'll need to make an asynchronous call to retrieve the balance. Here is the syntax:

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.loadRewards(new BranchReferralStateChangedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onStateChanged(boolean changed, Branch.BranchError error) {
        // changed boolean will indicate if the balance changed from what is currently in memory

        // will return the balance of the current user's credits
        int credits = branch.getCredits();
    }
});
```

### Redeem all or some of the reward balance (store state)

We will store how many of the rewards have been deployed so that you don't have to track it on your end. In order to save that you gave the credits to the user, you can call redeem. Redemptions will reduce the balance of outstanding credits permanently.

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.redeemRewards(5);
```

### Get credit history

This call will retrieve the entire history of credits and redemptions from the individual user. To use this call, implement like so:

```java
Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
branch.getCreditHistory(new BranchListResponseListener() {
    public void onReceivingResponse(JSONArray list, Branch.BranchError error) {
        if (error == null) {
            // show the list in your app
        } else {
            Log.i("MyApp", error.getMessage());
        }
    }
});
```

The response will return an array that has been parsed from the following JSON:
```json
[
    {
        "transaction": {
                           "date": "2014-10-14T01:54:40.425Z",
                           "id": "50388077461373184",
                           "bucket": "default",
                           "type": 0,
                           "amount": 5
                       },
        "event" : {
            "name": "event name",
            "metadata": { your event metadata if present }
        },
        "referrer": "12345678",
        "referree": null
    },
    {
        "transaction": {
                           "date": "2014-10-14T01:55:09.474Z",
                           "id": "50388199301710081",
                           "bucket": "default",
                           "type": 2,
                           "amount": -3
                       },
        "event" : {
            "name": "event name",
            "metadata": { your event metadata if present }
        },
        "referrer": null,
        "referree": "12345678"
    }
]
```
**referrer**
: The id of the referring user for this credit transaction. Returns null if no referrer is involved. Note this id is the user id in developer's own system that's previously passed to Branch's identify user API call.

**referree**
: The id of the user who was referred for this credit transaction. Returns null if no referree is involved. Note this id is the user id in developer's own system that's previously passed to Branch's identify user API call.

**type**
: This is the type of credit transaction

1. _0_ - A reward that was added automatically by the user completing an action or referral
1. _1_ - A reward that was added manually
2. _2_ - A redemption of credits that occurred through our API or SDKs
3. _3_ - This is a very unique case where we will subtract credits automatically when we detect fraud
